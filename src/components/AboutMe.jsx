            <p>
                I am Kevin Vang, a software engineer focusing on Full Stack developer.
                I am in trimester 5 my favorite languages to work with would be javascript.
                After finishing school, I would like to be able to find a career that teaches both back-end and front-end languages,
                if not then I would try to free-lance on the front-end side first, build up my profolio and gain more experience in programming.
                Some of my non school/work hobbies are listening to music, going to the gym and enjoying nature.
            </p>
        </div>
